# CommunityFitnessLandscape
This repository contains all source code and data used to develop the Microbial Community Fitness Landscape on a Chip.

## Experimental Design and Data Analysis
<!-----
Describe what this code was used for
----->
This code was written with a twofold purpose: to optimize experimental designs and to prcoess this data once it had been extracted.
This code runs via the command prompt in MatLab

### Optimizing Experimenal Design - Usage
Following the command prompt, the user can either generate a new layout or load a previous layout.
If the user generates a new layout, the user will be prompted for the number of microbes in their desired community and the desired number of devices they may wish to use. The user will be be presented with a data file containing the best layout and a picture containing a graphical representation of the layout to aid in experimental procedures.
If the user loads an old layout, they will be presented with the graphical layout of the file they selected.

### Data Analysis

Matlab - 2019a

## Image Processing and Data Extraction
<!-----
Describe what this code was used for
----->
This code was written to automate and aid the image processing and data extraction. A set of regions of interests (ROIs) were designed to rapidly extract data gathered durring flourescent microscopy.
These data were then exported into a CSV file to be processed using the MatLab script mentioned above.
